## Thermal conductivity plotting from the dumped values obtained from MD simulations


There are 4 files in this current directory:

1) K_generalized.m = generic function to plot kx, ky, kz

2) K_plot.m = thermal conductivity tensor --> plotting evolution of k w.r.to time, MATLAB code

3) log.lammps = sample log file from MD 

4) README.txt = this file
